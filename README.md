# BIOL331_hypothesis_testing
## Description
We conducted an experiment focused on UV light and its effects on the chick embryos in the span of a week. 
The experiment was repeated for a 2nd time.

## Files 
The csv file contains data collected during the lab of BIOL 331. 
The analysis contains all of the statistical tests conducted along with notes for interpretation.

## Groups in the experiment
Control: Incubated for 1 week in the dark. No exposure to light whatsoever. 
Treatment 1: exposed to UV for 48 hrs (2 days) and incubation continued in the in the same area as control for the remaining 5 days. 
Treatment 2: exposed to UV for 168 hours (full week) and incubated with exposure to UV
